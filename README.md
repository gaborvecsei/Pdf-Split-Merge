# PDFSM - Pdf Split & Merge

Simple tool to split and merge multiple pdf files

> I wanted to quickly select pages from pdf files and merge them into a single document but I did not find any
usable tool...So I made one in a few minutes :smiley:

## Install

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/gaborvecsei/pdf-split-merge.git
```

## Usage

Write a config file like this (`sample_config.txt`):

```
D:/my_folder/my_pdf_1.pdf 1-10,16,22
D:/my_folder/my_pdf_23.pdf 1-40
D:/my_folder/my_pdf_4.pdf 6,8,9-20

```

This means it will process the files sequentially top-down and include only the defined
pages in the final pdf document.

```
pdfsm -i sample_config.txt -o split_and_merge.pdf
```

You can use different file encoding:

```
pdfsm -i sample_config.txt -o split_and_merge.pdf -e utf8
```
